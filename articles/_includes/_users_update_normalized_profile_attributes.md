By default, normalized user profile attributes provided by identity providers other than Auth0 (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter) are not directly editable since they are updated from the identity provider each time a user logs in.

If you want to be able to edit the `name`, `nickname`, `given_name`, `family_name`, or `picture` attributes on the normalized user profile, you must [update the connection preferences for updates to the normalized user profile](/dashboard/guides/connections/update-connection-user-root-attributes) so that user attributes will be updated from the identity provider only on user profile creation. Root attributes will then be available to be [edited individually](/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) or [by bulk import](/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) using the Management API.
