# Universal Login Internationalization

## Internationalization in the New Universal Login Experience

The New Universal Login Experience is currently localized to:

- English 
- Spanish

We'll be adding more languages in the following weeks. It is not possible for you to add another language.

### Language Selection

There are several variables that are taken into consideration when deciding in which language the Universal Login pages are going to be rendered:

- The `Accept-Language` HTTP header sent by the browser. We assume that is the language preferred by the user, and respect it if possible.
- The languages supported by Auth0, listed above.
- The list of languages configured in Tenant Settings. This lets you limit the languages you want the pages to be rendered with and select a default one. For example, if your website can only be rendered in English, maybe you want the Universal Login pages to also be rendered in English, regardless the browser's settings.
- The value of the `ui_locales` parameter sent to the [authorization request endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest), which specifies the languages that the application redirecting to the Universal Login flow wants the login page to be rendered with. For example, in a news website you could pick the language for the content while logged out, and when logging in, see the login page in the same language.

## Internationalization in the Classic Universal Login Experience

In the Classic Universal Login experience, localization is done using our JavaScript widgets for [login](/libraries/lock/v11/i18n), the [password reset page](/universal-login/password-reset) and [password policies](/i18n/password-options). 

The [Guardian MFA page](/universal-login/guardian) by default uses the MFA Widget, which cannot be localized. You can create localized versions by using [guardian.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js).

It is not possible to localize the Consent page.
