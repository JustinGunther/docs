# Universal Login Internationalization

## Internationalization in the New Universal Login Experience

The New Universal Login Experience is currently localized to the languages above, with more languages to be added over time:

| Code   | Language  |
|--------|-----------|
| en     | English   |
| es     | Spanish   |
| da     | Danish    |
| de     | German    |
| fi     | Finnish   |
| fr     | French    |
| ja     | Japanese  |
| nb     | Norwegian |
| nl     | Dutch     |
| pt     | Portuguese|
| sv     | Swedish   |

### Language Selection

The language to render the pages will be selected based on:

- The languages supported by Auth0, listed above.
- The list of languages configured in Tenant Settings, where you can select the languages your tenant supports and select a default one.
- The value of the `ui_locales` parameter sent to the [authorization request endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest), which can be used to constrain the language list for an application or session.
- The `Accept-Language` HTTP header sent by the browser. The pages will be rendered in this language if it's allowed by the settings below. If not, pages will be rendered in the default language.

If you don't configure the list of languages in Tenant Settings:
  - if you don't specify the `ui_locales` parameter, the pages will be rendered in English.
  - if you specify the `ui_locales` parameter, pages will be rendered the browser's language when it's in that list, or the first language in the ui_locales list otherwise.

### Current Limitations

- It's not possible to add additional languages.
- It's not possible to override the copy for a specific text.
- The ui_locales parameter can only be used in OAuth flows, as itâ€™s not available in SAML or WS-Federation.
- The ui_locales parameter is not forwarded to upstream IdPs.
- The tenant languages can only be specified using the Management API.

## Internationalization in the Classic Universal Login Experience

In the Classic Universal Login experience, localization is done using our JavaScript widgets for [login](/libraries/lock/v11/i18n), the [password reset page](/universal-login/password-reset) and [password policies](/i18n/password-options). 

The [Guardian MFA page](/universal-login/guardian) by default uses the MFA Widget, which cannot be localized. You can create localized versions by using [guardian.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js).

It is not possible to localize the Consent page.
